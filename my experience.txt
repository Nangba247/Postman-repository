My Experience transiting from Content Creation to Software Testing in 4 weeks
At first, it sounds ambiguous; almost impossible to switch from content creation to software testing in four(4) weeks. “It always seems impossible until it's done - Nelson Mandela”

My journey from Creating youtube contents to software testing was bridged by a wonderful personality, Ibironke Yekini (Princess). Even though I love tech, I have always had an impression that tech is purely coding and you ain’t a tech person if you ain’t a nerd. 
I attended a Tech Conference hosted by Remnant Christian Network, Makurdi where Ibironke Yekini and Blessing Ejeh were presenting. They both demystify all my wrong ideas about tech and specifically software testing. Immediately, I took the challenge and made up my mind to enroll into Testify academy’s software testing course.

The first week of lecture was dedicated to acquainting all students with the platform to be used for the program, 80% of the lessons for that week were motivational. Immediately I became suspicious that this thing isn’t as easy as they presented hence, the need for a large dose of motivation pills. I was right, they started with the easy to the complex. I have learnt and executed many tasks already and did a group project on the eNaira app in 4 days.

Lastly I most applaud Testify Academy for well organizing their lessons and choice of programs to accommodate all and sundry, regardless of your background, they have the magic formula to transform you into your dreamed desire.  I have great colleagues, mentors and accountability partners, these people were always there to help through the process.
